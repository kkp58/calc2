                            <p>In <b>1966</b>, <u>Bob Taylor</u> of ARPA needed a separate terminal to log into each of several shared
                                computers at
                                research centers across the country. No two computers could talk to each other. So
                                Taylor had to move
                                from terminal to terminal to work on a different computer. He knew that a single
                                terminal would work, if
                                all the computers were in the same network.
                                Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for that job. Roberts had built the world's first
                                experimental connection
                                between two computers at the MIT Lincoln laboratories in Lexington, Massachusetts.
                                He lived with Leonard Kleinrock at MIT and learned about packet switching and queuing,
                                because he was his
                                officemate and so Roberts built the same kind of connection ARPAnet had, except it was
                                distributed to
                                more people.</p>

                            <p>In <b>1969</b>, time sharing was happening where you would
                                actually sit at a terminal and you would type in your questions and your programs and
                                the answer would come back in 2 seconds.
                                The plan was to network 4 identical IMPs. Each one was to be attached to a different
                                kind of mainframe computer and they were - a sigma seven at UCLA, and SDS 940 at the
                                SRI, and IBM 360/75 at the UCSB, and a PDP 10 at the University of Utah.
                                A small company in Cambridge, Bolt Beranek and Newman
                                known as BBN wasn't sure either, but they were willing to try. Frank Heart headed the
                                BBN team
                                BBN won the contract and had to build the IMP for the ARPANET on January 1st 1969, which
                                was due in 9 months with UCLA.
                                On September 1 1969, the first piece of hardware created
                                for the computer network that was the forerunner of the internet arrived at UCLA. It
                                needed a lot of improvements, but was just sent on itâ€™s due date. By the end of 1969,
                                all four sites were interconnected.</p>

                            <p>By <b>1972</b>, the ARPANET had 25 sites online. There was the first International Conference on
                                computers and communication sponsored by ARPA. Robert Metcalfe, grad from MIT and
                                Harvard was in charge of compiling a list of just what the network could do.
                                <u>Raymond Tomlinson</u> was working on a mail program, but it was a program for a single
                                computer, so that you could send messages from yourself to another user on the same time
                                sharing computer. He thought that it could be also done across the network. So he put
                                the code together, modified it a little bit and then the first email program was
                                created. He was the one to get the @ sign</p>

                            <p>In <b>1973</b>, <u>Vint Cerf</u> and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of rules or procedures known
                                as the <a href="concept.html">TCP/IP</a> protocol, that would allow computers to pass their message packets back
                                and forth.
                                Bob and Cerf concluded that they needed something called gateway that knew how to talk
                                to each of the networks it was connected to(could be two or more) and could encapsulate
                                packets coming from the host computers into packets going through the underlying
                                networks.

                                All the devices need to have some sort of unique addresses in order to connect to each
                                other. The protocol was designed called Internet Protocol(IP address). IPv4 address was
                                designed in 1973 and widely adopted in the early 80s.</p>
